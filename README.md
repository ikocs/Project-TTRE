# Project TTRE
 Project with code for communication with oscilloscope and something else. 

All instructions are in the folder Docs. The exapmles for communication with the oscilloscope in Py and ML also there. 
All scrtipts in Py are in the folder Apps. There you can find scripts for scope and PU and the main experimantal algorithm.

# Structure and logic
1. Rigol.py contains class for communication with the power unit Rigol and all basic methods
2. Agilent.py contains class for communcation with the oscilloscope Agilent D8600A and all basic methods
3. Experiment.py contains data exctraction and analises from the oscilloscope
4. Zero_code.py and one_code.py contains code for modulation of the Gaussian monocycles
5. Spectrum.py contains methods for spectrum analises of the pulses
